<h1 align="center">Token Transaction</h1>

This is the user manual for token transactions on personal computers. 
There are five steps for completing cross-chain transactions on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).
To illustrate the steps and further your understanding, We have used a token transaction between Metis and BSC on Poly Bridge an example.

To begin, make sure you have entered [Token Asset](https://bridge.poly.network/testnet/) of Poly Bridge.

### Step 1. Asset selection

First, you need to select the token you want to transfer. 
As shown in the graphic below, click on Asset, and select your token of choice in the pop-up window.

### Step 2. Network selection

After choosing an asset, click **From Network**, and select the source network from those available in the pop-up window. 
Select the target network, which is the network you are sending the tokens to, in the same way.

The following figure shows that Metis token will be sent from the Metis network to the BSC network.

### Step 3. Wallet connection

The next step is to connect the wallet. 
You can do this by either clicking **Connect Wallet** or by clicking on the **wallet icon**.  
The difference is that clicking **Connect Wallet** will enable you to select wallets both on the source and target network, as shown in the figure below.
