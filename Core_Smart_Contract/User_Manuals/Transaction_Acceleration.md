<h1 align="center">Transaction Acceleration</h1>

Poly Bridge has released the **acceleration function** to help users speed up transactions when dealing with congested networks. 
This manual will show you how to use this function with an example token transfer between **Arbitrum** and **Ethereum**.

To start, please check the status of your transaction.
After submitting a cross-chain transaction in Poly, click **SPEED UP** to use the **acceleration function**.

> If your transaction is only completed in the source chain, this function does not work.

Listed are three steps for you to accelerate your transaction on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).

### Step 1. Transaction selection
Find the transaction that you want to accelerate. Click **History** on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/) to view the previous transaction, as shown in the figure.

>- Please ensure that your wallet is connected to the **target network**. If not, you must first switch network and then return to the **Speed Up** page. Remember that the network settings in your wallet should be consistent with the target network in Poly Bridge.
>- If you havenâ€™t connected your **wallet** yet, the pop-up window will require you to connect your wallet. After that, exit the page and go back to the **Speed Up** page.


If you encounter an error report as shown in the figure, please do not resubmit this transaction. Return to your wallet to check the balance.
