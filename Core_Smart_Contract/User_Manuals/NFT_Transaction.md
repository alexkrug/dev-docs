<h1 align="center">NFT Transaction</h1>

This is the user manual for NFT transactions.
List below are the five steps for completing a cross-chain transaction on [Poly Bridge](https://bridge.poly.network/).
As an example, we use an NFT transaction between Bytom and BSC on Poly Bridge.


To start, make sure you have entered [NFT Asset](https://bridge.poly.network/testnet/nft) of Poly Bridge and reach the page below:

### Step 1. Wallet connection on source chain
You should **Connect your wallet** according to your needs, e.g., Bytom on MetaMask, by following the three steps shown below:

### Step 2. Chain selection
Then, **select chain and network** according to the wallet you have chosen. 
Make sure your wallet has switched to the **same network** as the chain you select now on this page.

**All existing NFT assets** will be displayed before your wallet is connected or switched to the appropriate chain, as shown in the figure below.

And a window will pop up suggesting you **connect your wallet** to this chain when you click any NFT assets on it, 
as shown here:

> The **Fee** collected by Poly shown on this page, is used to cover the transaction fee on the target chain.



You can click on the transaction hash to check its status during the transaction. 
Wait for several minutes, and you can check your transaction in **History**.
